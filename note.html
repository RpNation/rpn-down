            <h1>Site is temporarily unavailable.</h1>
            <p>The site has been down since yesterday because our hosting provider in Utah had a facility fire caused by a power failure. Most of their servers including ours are offline to check for water damage from the sprinklers and are waiting to hear back from them. They were optimistic about no data loss actually happening, so the site should be back online as soon as they plug us back in. </p>
            <p>If by some chance there is some damage and makes it so our data can't be restored, rest assured that we do take hourly backups of the site. At worst we'd only lose one hour of posts from restoring from a backup, but we are trying to be patient since we've never had data loss in the site's decade+ history. Please join us on Discord, so that we can keep each other company :)</p>
            <p>The site should be back tomorrow (April 6th)</p>
